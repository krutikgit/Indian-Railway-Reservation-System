# Indian Railway Reservation System

## Description

This is a Railway Reservation System developed in Java.
  
This project is based on the application and implementation of concepts and functions of OOPM. This Program is mainly based on the application and implementation of different functions, such as Swing, etc, in Java. Swing is used to add buttons, labels, frames, and other similar elements for easy user understanding and display of the code.

## Steps

1. The program prompts the user to initiate the reservation procedure, then requests input on which train express they want to use, based on the displayed choice menu. 
2. Now, the user has to decide the number of passengers for whom he wants to book the tickets after he has decided on the train express.   
3. After deciding the number of passengers who want to travel, the cost will be displayed. This cost will be based on the train express selected and the number of passengers selected.  
4. The maximum size defined in this program is 5 for input passengers, so only maximum of five tickets can be booked at a time. No more tickets can be booked, as it may exceed the limit.  
5. Once the purpose of the code is served, it basically makes an exit. 
6. The code can be run again for fresh bookings!
